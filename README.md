# email-client
Email client for the email WS

##Getting Started
1. clone the repo
2. cd to the folder and run `pod install` (if you don't have cocoapods installed, then google how to install them on a mac)
3. open the file SampleEmailApp.xcworkspace in XCode
4. select a simulator (tested on iPhone 7) and run the code (you may need to select your development profile as the code signing identity)

Rest of the app is quite simple and should be mostly self-explanatory. Some of the features that the email-ws web server supports are not yet supported in the iOS client here.
